DIFFERENT KINDS OF OBJECTS -------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Object is a container for values in the form of properties and functionality in the form of methods. 

Objects
- provide functionality through methods, which may or may not return values
- provide data storage in properties
- the name of a property is a key
- the contents of a property is known as a value


Types of Objects:
    Native Objects - number, string, array, boolean

    Host Objects (Web Browser) - document, console, Element
    
    Your Own Objects
    
State refers to the condition of all values at a particular point in time. 
Benefits of creating an Object in Code:
    - Hides complexities of how things work from the developer using your object
    - Great for organizing code, keeping everything together for a specific object (Encapsulation)


OBJECT LITERAL REVIEW  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Literals store the state of a thing.

There are two ways to access properties on object literals, dot notation and square bracket notation.
    
Object Literal Example:
    var person = {
        name: "Lauren",
        treehouseStudent: true
    }
    
person.name;
person.treehouseStudent;

person["name"];  
person["treehouseStudent"];
    

UNDERSTANDING THIS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

var dice = {
    sides: 6, // local scope, property of dice object 
    roll: function diceRoll() {
        var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * dice.sides) + 1;
        console.log(randomNumber);
    }
}
